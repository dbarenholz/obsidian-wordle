**NO LONGER MAINTAINED:** Wordle has been taken over by NYT, and I do not wish to support them in any way.

# Wordle for Obsidian

**NOTE: This is no longer actively maintained.**

This is an [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) plugin that allows you to play the [Wordle](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/) game directly from the editor!
It has been developed for Obsidian **v0.13.19**, and tested on **Windows**.

## Installing

Grab the latest release from the **releases** page, and copy all files to `.obsidian/plugins/obsidian-wordle/`. That's it!
When approved, you can also install this through Obsidian by searching for **wordle**.

## Roadmap

For now, nothing is planned.
If you're interested in features, make an issue on Github!

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome, as long as you explain what you're adding into the plugin. 

## Pricing

This is free. Keep your money, I don't want it.

## Changelog

**Version 0.0.2**:

- Replace link with the NYT link.
- Add maintenance notice.

**Version 0.0.1**:

- Wordle is now playable through Obsidian!
